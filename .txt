- HOW TO IMPLEMENT & TRAIN OWN MODEL


1) WE HAVE DATA OF MALE FEMALE  LABEL
2) THEN WE TrainImprove.py where we  train our data & from that  we build
- gender_prediction_model_onLarge.h5 and  tfidf_vectorizer_onLarge.joblib file 
3) ml-st1.py ( streamlit ) provide user interface  &  use that model and  tfdif vector for gender verfication.
